    <h2>Recent years of Alonso's F1 Career:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2016: </strong>In the Australian Grand Prix, Alonso was involved in a crash with Esteban Gutiérrez in turn 3; the contact caused Alonso's car to barrel roll into the concrete barrier[100] at 180 mph. Alonso suffered a partially collapsed lung and rib fractures, and was replaced by Stoffel Vandoorne for the Bahrain Grand Prix.[101] He returned for the Chinese Grand Prix but could only finish 12th, one place ahead of teammate Jenson Button. At the Russian Grand Prix Alonso scored his first points of the season, with a 6th-place finish, his second highest since returning to McLaren in 2015. He drove to another strong result two races later at Monaco Grand Prix, finishing fifth, holding off Nico Rosberg's Mercedes in the latter half of the race. Alonso went on a four race scoreless run, retiring from the European Grand Prix, and failed to finish but was classified 18th for the Austrian Grand Prix. After the summer break at the Belgian Grand Prix, Alonso and former teammate Lewis Hamilton, collected upwards of 50 grid place penalties each for changing more than the allowed engine parts, and so occupied the back row of the grid. However Alonso and Hamilton battled through the field, benefiting from the red flag brought out by Kevin Magnussen's huge crash at the top of Eau Rouge, and finished 7th and 3rd respectively. At the Malaysian Grand Prix, Alonso took a 45 place grid penalty and started the race from the very back of the grid, but finished in 7th, just as in Belgium.</li>
  <br>    <li><strong>2015: </strong>In November 2014 both Alonso and Scuderia Ferrari announced that the 2014 season would be his last with the team. In December 2014 it was announced that Alonso would return to McLaren for the first time since 2007 on what has been reported to be a two-year deal with an option for extension. After protracted speculation it was announced that 2009 world champion Jenson Button would race alongside him in 2015, beating rookie Dane Kevin Magnussen to the drive.[89]<br>

On the second day of the Barcelona pre-season test Alonso had an accident at turn 3. He was airlifted to the General Hospital de Catalunya in Sant Cugat del Vallès, where he underwent scans which found that he had suffered a concussion.[90] After regaining consciousness, some newspapers engaged in unconfirmed reports stating that Alonso suffered from retrograde amnesia in which he had no memories beyond 1995 and believed that he was still a karting driver.[91] However, Alonso firmly denied this upon his Grand Prix return in Malaysia, saying that it was just a fun story that he read in the papers and did not actually happen.[92] He also said that he did not know what caused the crash and suspected a faulty steering column, saying that "not even a hurricane" could have caused the car to crash, amid speculation that a gust of wind threw the car into the inside wall at an odd angle.[93] He also said that he never lost consciousness upon impact, and that it was because of medication being given to him prior to the helicopter ride for the MRI scan and that he had remembered everything before the impact as well as his reaction immediately afterwards.[94] Alonso was released from hospital on 4 March and was advised to miss the Australian Grand Prix in order to minimise the chance of suffering second-impact syndrome. Magnussen was announced to take his place.[95]</li><br>
      <li><strong>2014: </strong>A new rule for the 2014 season was that the drivers picked a unique car number they would use for the rest of their Formula One career. Alonso picked number 14 as he used the number in his karting career and considers it to be a lucky number.[87] Alonso and Ferrari had a difficult season, but went close to winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, before being overtaken by Daniel Ricciardo only a couple of laps before the finish.[88] Alonso finished sixth in the championship, with only one other podium, a third-place finish in China. In spite of his worst championship position during his time with Ferrari, he was far ahead of teammate Kimi Räikkönen in the championship.</li>
